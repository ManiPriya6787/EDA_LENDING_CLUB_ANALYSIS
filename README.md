EDA for Lending Club Analysis

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case study on the Lending Club loan dataset. The primary objective is to identify patterns and risk factors associated with defaulted loans, helping stakeholders minimize credit losses by targeting high-risk applicants.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze Lending Club data and identify characteristics of risky loan applicants using EDA techniques, enabling data-driven decision-making to reduce loan defaults.

## 📁 Project Structure

## ⚙️ Steps Followed

1. **Data Understanding** – Getting familiar with the dataset features and target.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, filtering columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing and understanding loan trends.
4. **Insights & Recommendations** – Deriving actionable insights from the data.

## 📌 Key Observations

- **Loan Purpose:** Defaulted loans are highest for *Debt Consolidation*.
- **Annual Income:** Applicants earning between **31k–58k** are riskier.

- **Interest Rates:**
  - For **21–24%**, keep income **75k–78k**
